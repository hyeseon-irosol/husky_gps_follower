# Husky GPS Follower 

This workspace has src folder and dependencies for navigating the Husky robot using GPS in simulation.

## Installation
```bash
$ sudo apt install ros-humble-clearpath-desktop
$ mkdir ~/clearpath/
$ cd ~/clearpath/
$ Download robot.yaml in clearpath folder you created from this [repo](https://github.com/hyeseon-irosol/husky_config/tree/main/clearpath)
```

```bash
$ cd ~/clearpath_ws/
$ git clone https://github.com/hyeseon-irosol/husky_gps_follower.git
$ colcon build
```

## Network setting

* Please connect with the same wifi network Husky is using.

* If you want to run the simulation Husky in Gazebo, the ROS_MASTER_URI should be another IP address, not a Husky IP address.

  In the Dockerfile, the address might change from your IP address. Please check it using "ifconfig"

  : RUN echo "export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:11311" >> /home/${USERNAME}/.bashrc

## How to use the packages from [Tinker-Twins](https://github.com/Tinker-Twins/Husky)

1. Keyboard Teleoperation:
    ```bash
    $ roslaunch husky_gazebo husky_playpen.launch
    $ roslaunch husky_control teleop_keyboard.launch
    ```

2. Map-Less Navigation:
    ```bash
    $ roslaunch husky_gazebo husky_playpen.launch
    $ roslaunch husky_viz view_robot.launch
    $ roslaunch husky_navigation map_less_navigation.launch
    ```

3. Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM):
    ```bash
    $ roslaunch husky_gazebo husky_playpen.launch
    $ roslaunch husky_viz view_robot.launch
    $ roslaunch husky_navigation gmapping.launch
    $ roslaunch husky_control teleop_keyboard.launch
    ```
    To save generated map to current working directory, run:
    ```bash
    $ rosrun map_server map_saver -f <filename>
    ```

4. Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL):
    ```bash
    $ roslaunch husky_gazebo husky_playpen.launch
    $ roslaunch husky_viz view_robot.launch
    $ roslaunch husky_navigation amcl.launch
    $ roslaunch husky_control teleop_keyboard.launch
    ```

5. Map-Based Navigation:
    ```bash
    $ roslaunch husky_gazebo husky_playpen.launch
    $ roslaunch husky_viz view_robot.launch
    $ roslaunch husky_navigation map_based_navigation.launch
    ```
