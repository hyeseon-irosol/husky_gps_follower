[2.507s]   No project() command is present.  The top-level CMakeLists.txt file must
[2.507s]   contain a literal, direct call to the project() command.  Add a line of

[2.521s]   CMake is pretending there is a "project(Project)" command on the first

[2.525s] This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
